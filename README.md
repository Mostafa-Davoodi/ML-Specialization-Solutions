# Machine Learning Specialization - Coursera Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments from the Machine Learning Specialization offered by Coursera, in collaboration with Stanford University. The specialization is taught by Professor Andrew Ng and covers a wide range of topics in machine learning, from linear regression to neural networks.

**Note: Please use these solutions only as a reference for your own understanding.**
